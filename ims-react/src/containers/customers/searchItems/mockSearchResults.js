At-risk families included single parents, large families, and low income populations. Children harmed by abuse or neglect were most often identified by schools.

Emphasis was placed onthe need to ensure the safety, well-being, and stability of children and their families. The foundation principles also recommend the expansion and reallocation of resources, respect and dignity for people being served within the system, cross-training for service providers, systems for information-sharing and confidentiality, and evaluation systems.

          "description": "This book by the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, commonly called the Greenbook, provides communities a framework to develop interventions and measure progress as they seek to improve their responses to families experiencing spouse abuse and child maltreatment. It presents community and institutional leaders with a context-setting tool to develop public policy aimed at keeping families safe and stable. The book is divided into 5 chapters. Chapter 1 articulates an overall principle of safety, well-being, and stability for all victims of family violence and the need to hold batterers accountable for their violence. In chapter 2, a series of principles are developed to guide communities in structuring their responses to families experiencing dual forms of violence. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 focus on specific recommendations for the child protection system, the network of domestic violence service providers, and the juvenile or other trial courts with jurisdiction over child maltreatment cases. Three appendices provide the following information: definitions; federal legislation; and curricula, protocols, and publications. Numerous references.",

Part Two describes the responsibilities of agency attorneys and methods for managing the legal staff. Strategies for establishing caseload standards, staffing, and working with caseworkers are discussed. Chapter Ten specifically addresses considerations for ensuring the agency's compliance with the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. The book includes two case studies of teamwork and a set of sample forms, including a job description, a program brochure for professional training, a paternity tracking sheet, performance evaluations, and performance standards.",

          "description": "This study examined the methods used by states to collect data about child abuse and neglect within the Native American population to determine the accuracy of national statistics. Interviews were conducted with representatives from 57 tribes and officials from 21 states about investigation procedures and the maintenance of statistics at the tribal and state level. An analysis of the interviews revealed that only a portion of child abuse and neglect cases in the American Indian community are recorded by the state. About one-fourth of Indian child abuse and neglect cases are investigated by the tribe only. Other cases are investigated by a combination of agencies including the tribe (65 percent); states (42 percent); counties (19 percent); Bureau of Indian Affairs (19 percent); and a consortium (9 percent). States and counties only report the cases in which they have been involved, which suggests that a maximum of 61 percent of all cases are tracked in the data collection system. Fewer than 20 percent of tribes have an automated record keeping system and only 3.5 percent forward reports to a national database, such as the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System. The tribes lack the technical and financial resources to develop a database of child abuse statistics and so must rely on the states and counties to report their information. The author recommends greater coordination in the collection of data and more support for tribes to establish their own recordkeeping systems. 43 references, 4 figures, 3 tables.",

          "description": "As part of the national evaluation of family support programs mandated by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, the Administration on Children, Youth and Families contracted with Abt Associates Inc. to conduct a meta-analysis of existing research about the effectiveness of different types of programs and the impact of services on families with a variety of needs and characteristics. The meta-analysis provides a statistical summary of 665 studies of 260 programs. In general, the findings revealed that family support services resulted in slight improvements in some outcomes. However, existing research has not identified one model that is effective for all groups of people. The majority of programs did not have a significant impact on parents' knowledge about child development, their attitudes about child rearing, or family functioning. The most effective programs used a group approach for parent education and support and targeted specific types of families. Professional staff achieved greater success than paraprofessional staff. Direct services to children had greater impact on cognitive development than parent education. Positive effects also were found for services that were directed toward teen mothers with young children, families with children who have special needs, and families with children who have behavior problems. The meta-analysis concludes that program administrators and policymakers should review the assumptions of current programs and identify approaches that will improve the effectiveness of family support services. The report details the methodology of the meta-analysis and the characteristics of the programs and studies. 26 references, numerous figures and tables.",

Los maestros y otros adultos son animados para identificar cambios en el comportamiento t pico de los ni&ntilde;os y de proporcionar oportunidades para que ellos comuniquen sus sentimientos mediante las artes, historias, y drama. Los adultos deben tambi&eacute;n asegurar que los ni&ntilde;os se sientan salvos y en control. Los expertos hacen recuerdo a los adultos a reconocer sus propias reacciones a trauma para que ellos est&eacute;n preparados a ayudar a sus hijos.

Este material fue seleccionado y presentado originalmente por la Oficina sobre Abuso y Negligencia Infantil (OCAN, iniciales en ingl&eacute;s) y el National Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information (Centro de Informaci&oacute;n Nacional Sobre el Maltrato de Menores), conjuntamente con Prevent Child Abuse America, para el Mes de la Prevenci&oacute;n del Maltrato de Menores (abril) 2003. El paquete, ahora actualizado para 2004, incluye lo siguiente: Una perspectiva general del maltrato de menores (el alcance nacional del problema, lo que es el maltrato de menores, y lo que es la prevenci&oacute;n del maltrato de menores); lo que las organizaciones pueden hacer (llevando a su comunidad por la puerta hacia la prevenci&oacute;n, un equipo de prensa con informaci&oacute;n sobre como involucrar a los medios masivos, como involucrar a los portavoces locales, sugerencias para preparar a padres portavoces, puntos de discusi&oacute;n, ejemplo de carta solicitando la emisi&oacute;n de un anuncio de servicio p&uacute;blico, ejemplo de anuncios de servicio p&uacute;blico para la radio y televisi&oacute;n, y donde se puede encontrar datos sobre el maltrato de menores relacionados con su Estado o comunidad local); lo que pueden hacer los individuos (construyendo puertas hacia la prevenci&oacute;n en su comunidad, calendario del mes de la prevenci&oacute;n, reportando el maltrato de menores, y sugerencias para ser un padre alentador incluyendo tiempo libre, el poder de elegir, ganando la guerra de las tareas, la rivalidad entre hermanos, estableciendo reglas y consecuencias con los j&oacute;venes, que significa ser mam&aacute; o pap&aacute;); un directorio de recursos que contiene organizaciones nacionales con asociaciones locales y organizaciones nacionales que proporcionan informaci&oacute;n, capacitaci&oacute;n y asistencia t&eacute;cnica; y un p&oacute;ster.

          "description": "Domestic violence is a devastating social problem that affects every segment of the population. While system responses are primarily targeted towards adult victims of abuse, increasing attention is now focused on the children who witness domestic violence. Studies estimate that 10 to 20 percent of children are at risk for exposure to domestic violence. Research also indicates children exposed to domestic violence are at an increased risk of being abused or neglected, and that a majority of studies reveal there are adult and child victims in 30 to 60 percent of families who experience domestic violence. This manual provides background on this complex topic and addresses the following practice issues: The overlap between child maltreatment and domestic violence; The basics of domestic violence; Modifying child protection practice with families experiencing domestic violence; Enhancing caseworker safety and support in child protection cases involving domestic violence; and Building collaborative responses for families experiencing domestic violence. Appendices include a glossary of terms, child, victim, and alleged perpetrator domestic violence assessments, safety plans, and information about developing a memorandum of understanding.",

It also may be used by other professionals involved in child abuse and neglect interventions, such as child protective services, mental health, law enforcement, health care, and early childhood professionals, to gain a better understanding of the role of educators in child protection. Specifically, this manual addresses the following topics: Identifying reasons why educators are concerned; Recognizing child abuse and neglect; Reporting child abuse and neglect; Providing support after the report; and Preventing child abuse and neglect. Appendices include an educators' checklist for recognizing possible child maltreatment and a sample report of suspected child abuse and neglect.",

          "description": "This manual, designed to examine the roles that teachers, school counselors, school social workers, school nurses, special education professionals, administrators, and other school personnel have in helping maltreated children, provides the basis for the involvement of educators in combating the problem of child abuse and neglect. It also may be used by other professionals involved in child abuse and neglect interventions, such as child protective services, mental health, law enforcement, health care, and early childhood professionals, to gain a better understanding of the role of educators in child protection. Specifically, this manual addresses the following topics: Identifying reasons why educators are concerned; Recognizing child abuse and neglect; Reporting child abuse and neglect; Providing support after the report; and Preventing child abuse and neglect. Appendices include an educators' checklist for recognizing possible child maltreatment and a sample report of suspected child abuse and neglect.",

          "description": "Adoption subsidies are perhaps the single-most powerful tool by which the child welfare system can encourage adoption and support adoptive families. Yet little is known about the factors associated with the receipt and amount of subsidies. Data from the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) offer an opportunity to examine how states use adoption subsidies to help achieve goals of permanency and well-being for children. Of particular interest to this study are patterns of subsidy receipt, the role of federal support for adoption subsidies under Title IV-E, and the relationship between adoption subsidies and adoption outcomes, including the rate of adoptions among eligible children and the timeliness of adoption. Questions of interest include the extent and funding of subsidies; the relationship between children's characteristics, foster care experiences, and subsidy receipt and amount; and variations among states in subsidy practice. These analyses use AFCARS data representing all adoptions during the years FY 1999 to FY 2001. Findings indicate: 1) Nearly all children adopted from foster care in recent years received an adoption subsidy; 2) The median monthly adoption subsidy was $444 per month; 3) Among newly adopted children receiving subsidies, 84 percent received federal adoption assistance through Title IV-E; 4) Children's age and special needs status influenced subsidy receipt and amount; 5) Pre-adoptive relationship and other characteristics of adoptive families influenced children's subsidies; and 6) Analyses found some support for associations between subsidies and adoption outcomes.

The study utilized an 18-State data set of 192,392 perpetrators identified by the child protective services system during 2002. The relationship of the perpetrators to the child victims, as well as whether the perpetrator acted alone or with another person, was considered along with demographic characteristics of both perpetrators and victims, and circumstances of the maltreatment. Research questions were: 1) What are the characteristics of male perpetrators of child maltreatment? 2) What specific patterns of child maltreatment are associated with male perpetrators? 3) What outcomes are associated with male perpetrators of child maltreatment? and 4) How does the presence of a mother coperpetrator influence the circumstances surrounding the child maltreatment or the outcomes? Findings indicate that females outnumbered male perpetrators among cases investigated by CPS, by a margin of 10 percent; more than one-half of the male perpetrators where biological fathers; patterns of sexual abuse were more common among male perpetrators; with the exception of mothers' boyfriends, more than one-half of male perpetrators in all father categories received some services; and although recidivism rates were low, biological fathers were more likely to be perpetrators of maltreatment again than were most other male perpetrators.

          "description": "This study was designed to extend current understanding of foster parent retention by producing unbiased estimates of length of service and examining factors associated with licensure, provision of care, and length of service. The study used administrative data, applying data management and analytic methods that have been used to describe the length of stay for children in foster care. Principal research questions include: How have the characteristics of foster parents changed over time? How can variations in activity levels be described, and what foster parent characteristics are associated with varying activity levels? What is the typical length of service for foster parents? and What characteristics are associated with variations in length of foster parent careers? Child welfare agencies in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Oregon contributed data for these analyses. Three key findings indicate: 1) Length of service in foster parenting is shorter than many managers would expect. The median length of service of 8 to 14 months estimated with a longitudinal model for these states is a distinct contrast to the mean time in foster parenting of 5 to 8 years reported in earlier studies. In the three states studied, between 47 and 62 percent of foster parents exited foster parenting within a year of the first placement in their home. 2) Foster parent \"burn-out\" cannot be identified as a factor in length of service. Higher foster home occupancy and higher levels of care for infants, adolescents, and children with special needs were consistently associated with greater length of service. 3) One-fifth of the foster parent population provides 60 to 80 percent of all foster care. These foster parents may represent a core group of active and experienced foster parents, with whom child welfare workers feel most confident placing children. An appendix lists characteristics of licensed foster parents in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Oregon. (Author abstract modified)",

          "description": "This study was designed to extend current understanding of foster parent retention by producing unbiased estimates of length of service and examining factors associated with licensure, provision of care, and length of service. The study used administrative data, applying data management and analytic methods that have been used to describe the length of stay for children in foster care. Principal research questions include: How have the characteristics of foster parents changed over time? How can variations in activity levels be described, and what foster parent characteristics are associated with varying activity levels? What is the typical length of service for foster parents? and What characteristics are associated with variations in length of foster parent careers? Child welfare agencies in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Oregon contributed data for these analyses. Three key findings indicate: 1) Length of service in foster parenting is shorter than many managers would expect. The median length of service of 8 to 14 months estimated with a longitudinal model for these states is a distinct contrast to the mean time in foster parenting of 5 to 8 years reported in earlier studies. In the three states studied, between 47 and 62 percent of foster parents exited foster parenting within a year of the first placement in their home. 2) Foster parent \"burn-out\" cannot be identified as a factor in length of service. Higher foster home occupancy and higher levels of care for infants, adolescents, and children with special needs were consistently associated with greater length of service. 3) One-fifth of the foster parent population provides 60 to 80 percent of all foster care. These foster parents may represent a core group of active and experienced foster parents, with whom child welfare workers feel most confident placing children. An appendix lists characteristics of licensed foster parents in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Oregon. (Author abstract modified)",

Nationwide, approximately two-thirds of referrals received were accepted for investigation or assessment. Fifty-eight percent of the investigated cases were later classified as unsubstantiated. The maltreatment rate was 11.9 per 1,000 children in 2004. 64.5% of the children were neglected, 17.5% were physically abused, 9.7% were sexually abused, and 7% were emotionally maltreated.

          "description": "This study documents that nonresident fathers of children in foster care are not often involved in case planning efforts and nearly half are never contacted by the child welfare agency during their child's stay in foster care. By not reaching out to fathers, caseworkers may overlook potential social connections and resources that could help to achieve permanency for the child. A total of 1,222 local agency caseworkers were interviewed by phone about 1,958 specific cases between October 2004 and February 2005 to examine front-line practices related to nonresident fathers. Interviewers achieved an 83% response rate to the survey. Cases were selected from among children who had been in foster care at least 3 months but no more than 36 months. Children in the sample were all in foster care for the first time, and the child welfare agency's records indicated that each of the children's biological fathers was alive but not living in the home from which the child was removed. Additionally, only one child per mother was eligible for the study. The results of this study provide empirical evidence on the steps that child welfare agencies currently take to identify, locate and involve nonresident fathers in case planning; the barriers encountered; and the policies and practices that affect involvement.",

In most jurisdictions, CPS is the agency mandated by law to conduct an initial assessment or investigation of reports of child abuse or neglect. CPS does not work alone. Many community professionals -- including law enforcement officers, health care providers, mental health professionals, educators, legal and court system personnel, and substitute care providers -- are involved in efforts to prevent, identify, investigate and treat child abuse and neglect. In addition, community and faith-based organizations, substance abuse treatment facilities, advocates for victims of domestic violence, extended family members, and concerned citizens play important roles in supporting families and in keeping children safe from harm. Typically, CPS is the lead agency in coordinating the efforts of the various disciplines working to protect children and to educate the community about the problems of child abuse and neglect.",

Through the initiative, ACF seeks to improve the well-being of children and families already receiving help from other ACF programs, as well as by supporting the development of community-wide initiatives that involve many different types of organizations. This publication showcases some of the programs that organizations have developed using ACF grants and demonstrates how these programs are helping to create successful marital partnerships. This publication also provides insight into some of the lessons learned along the way that other agencies and organizations can use to promote healthy marriage in their communities.

          "description": "To carry out their responsibilities of protecting children at risk of maltreatment, CPS caseworkers must effectively engage families that often both present and face great challenges. These can include substance abuse, mental health problems, economic stress, unemployment, separation and divorce, inadequate housing, crime, and incarceration. Figuring out how best to work with and engage these families, always with the safety of and permanency for the child as the goal, is not easy. This manual also speaks to both the opportunities and challenges presented by one participant in the family sagas that CPS caseworkers deal with everyday: the father. Working with fathers who are the perpetrators of child maltreatment is different than working with mothers or other perpetrators. In addition, fathers whose children were victimized by someone else, even fathers not living with their children, can prove to be a valuable ally as the CPS caseworker pursues his or her case planning objectives. Whether the father is the perpetrator or not, the abuse of a child can be a direct affront to how a father views himself as a man and a father. How well a caseworker understands these reactions and feelings and how effectively the caseworker can address them will make a major difference when trying to either help an abusing father become a protecting father or engaging a father as an ally in addressing the family dynamics that made the situation unsafe for the child. Effectively involving fathers in case planning and service provision presents unique challenges for caseworkers. This may explain in part why they often may not include fathers. This manual is also known as, \"The Fatherhood Manual,\" and \"The Fatherhood User Manual.\"",

          "description": "Most children in foster care are not living with their fathers at the time they are removed from their homes, and once in substitute care, these children may experience even less contact with their nonresident fathers. Yet fathers and their relatives represent half of a child's potential family connections and kin resources. If ignored, important social or financial support for the child may be missed as permanency planning is conducted. Fathers or their relatives may be potential substitute caregivers for the child, may support a reunification plan with child support, respite or other assistance, or may voluntarily relinquish parental rights in support of an adoption plan. Without contact from the caseworker, such potential contributions cannot be assessed. Consequently, child welfare and child support agencies have placed new emphasis on identifying, locating, and involving nonresident fathers of children served by the child welfare system.

The data are presented in aggregate and by state, and trends are reported when available. Topics include sources of reports; time for response; victimization rates; types of maltreatment; age, race and gender of victims; age and gender of perpetrators; relationship of perpetrators to the victim; number of child fatalities; types of services provided; and additional research related to child maltreatment. During FFY 2006, an estimated 905,000 children in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico were determined to be victims of abuse or neglect. The rate and number of children who were victims of child abuse or neglect is lower for FFY 2006 than it was five years ago. During 2002, children were abused or neglected at a rate of 12.3 per thousand children in the population resulting in an estimated 910,000 victims; for 2006, the rate was 12.1, resulting in an estimated 905,000 victims. The rate and number of all children who received an investigation or assessment increased since 2002. For 2002, the rate was 43.8 children per thousand in the population, resulting in an estimated 3,240,000 children who received an investigation or assessment; for 2006, the rate was 47.8 resulting in an estimated 3,573,000 children. Nationally, 64.1 percent of child victims experienced neglect, 16.0 percent were physically abused, 8.8 percent were sexually abused, and 6.6 percent were emotionally or psychologically maltreated. Rates of victimization by maltreatment type have fluctuated only slightly during the past several years. For FFY 2006, a nationally estimated 1,530 children died of abuse or neglect -- a rate of 2.04 children per 100,000 in the national population, which is more than the rate of 1.96 children per 100,000 in the national population for FFY 2005.

          "description": "Studies of former foster youth who age out of care find that these youth generally experience high unemployment, unstable employment patterns, and earn very low incomes in the period between ages 18 and 21. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) requested this study to examine employment and earnings outcomes for youth, through their mid-twenties, who age out of foster care. The key question and focus of the study is whether foster youth catch up or continue to experience less employment and significantly lower earnings than their peers even into their mid-twenties. The study linked child welfare, Unemployment Insurance (UI), and public assistance administrative data to assess employment outcomes and welfare receipt for youth who age out of foster care. Child welfare data allow researchers to identify youth who age out of foster care, while the UI data provide information on employment and earnings. Public assistance data reveal later welfare receipt. Information is linked between sources using youths' social security numbers. Analyses are conducted in three states: California, Minnesota, and North Carolina. The sample of interest is youth who were 17 years old and in foster care in one of the participating states on December 31, 1998, and who eventually aged out of care. A comparison group of youth from low-income families is created using the public assistance data, and baseline national estimates are derived from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97). Descriptive, multivariate, and trajectory analysis techniques are employed. Youth outcomes are assessed from age 16 to the first quarter of age 24. (Author abstract)",

          "description": "This second double issue on differential response discusses practice, policy, and research related to understanding and implementing a differential response approach as an alternative to traditional investigations into child abuse or neglect. It begins by explaining that differential response focuses on partnering with families to provide services that meet their needs while dismissing the labels of perpetrator and victim and removing the determination or finding. Following articles summarize key findings for the 2006 National Study on Differential Response in Child Welfare; findings from the Parent Support Outreach Project, a pilot project in Minnesota that created a preventive pathway for families; findings for the Another Road to Safety program based in Alameda County, California; findings from the implementation of differential response in 11 rural counties in Northern California; findings from a review of the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System on the safety of children served through differential response pathways; and findings related to the use of the North California Family Assessment Scale for General Services, a family assessment instrument designed for differential response. The final two articles explore the possible intersections and common values between differential response and family involvement strategies, and the importance of partnering with families in order to successfully sustain system changes such as differential response.
